//! Content-side interning for the display list builder.
//!
//! An [`Interner`] lives in the `DisplayListBuilder` and is *retained across
//! builds*: it is deliberately not touched by `DisplayListBuilder::reset`. That
//! gives two kinds of de-duplication for free:
//!
//! * **Within one build** - pushing the same item twice hashes to the same
//!   entry and yields the same [`Handle`], so the item's data is written into
//!   the display list once instead of once per occurrence.
//! * **Across builds** - an item that survives into the next display list is
//!   still in the map, so it keeps the same handle and its data is not
//!   re-transmitted at all.
//!
//! Instead of the data, the display list carries a [`Handle`]: a slot index
//! plus the build in which the item was first interned. Because the handle is
//! stable for as long as the entry lives, an unchanged item produces identical
//! display list bytes from one build to the next.
//!
//! The receiver keeps a slot-indexed store of the item data. It is fed by the
//! [`InternOps`] delta that [`Interner::end_build`] returns at the end of each
//! build: the adds minted during that build, and the removes produced by that
//! build's garbage collection. The receiver is a pure follower and never talks
//! back. Because it only ever follows, the deltas form a strict sequence -
//! every one has to be delivered, in order, or the two sides are out of step
//! for good.
//!
//! A builder holds one interner per interned type, gathered in [`DlInterners`].
//! They are begun and ended together, bracketed by [`DlInterners::begin_build`]
//! and [`DlInterners::end_build`], and share one build number, so what crosses
//! the IPC boundary is a single [`DlDelta`] per display list: the builder's
//! identity, the build it closes, and one [`InternOps`] per type. The set of
//! types is the list in [`enumerate_dl_interned_types!`], which the receiver
//! mirrors field for field.
//!
//! Garbage collection runs once per build, in `end_build`. An entry is dropped
//! once it has been absent from [`RETAIN_BUILDS`] consecutive display lists,
//! which frees its slot for re-use and emits a remove op. The delay is not
//! what keeps the receiver safe - it applies a remove only together with the
//! scene built from the list that no longer references the entry - it is
//! there so that content flickering an item in and out does not re-send it.
//!
//! Garbage collection frees entries but not the capacity they occupied, so
//! after one very large scene the containers would otherwise stay sized for it
//! for the life of the builder. `end_build` therefore also counts the builds
//! since the interner last filled more than half its capacity, and once that
//! reaches [`SHRINK_AFTER_BUILDS`] it reallocates the containers down to what
//! is live. The wait is hysteresis: a scene that alternates between large and
//! small should not pay for a reallocation each way.
