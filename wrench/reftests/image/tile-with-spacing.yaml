    # TODO: This test would be more useful if we used an image with variations instead
    # of a solid color. To do this we first need to change the way pixel snapping is
    # applied so that when an image is split into several primitives, so that the latter
    # all get snapped the same way rather than independently.
    #- image: xy_gradient(300, 300)
    - image: solid_color(255, 0, 0, 255, 300, 300)
