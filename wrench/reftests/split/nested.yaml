# This tests have a A(3D) -> B(2D) -> C(3D) context chain.
# All 3 contexts end up getting baked, but C last one doesn't participate in the
# same plane splitting pass as `A` and `B`, because it's separated from them by a
# non-preserve-3D parent `B`.
# `B` is layed out in the same plane as the parent, so should be ordered
# after `A`, given that it's coming later than the parent.
