//! Follower storage for items interned by the content process display list
//! builder. See `doc/dl-builder-interning.md` for the whole design.
//!
//! Content mints slot numbers per display list builder, starting at zero, so
//! two pipelines collide in a single store. The scene builder hands each
//! pipeline a dense `DlNamespace` the first time it sees one of that
//! pipeline's display lists, and a `DlHandle` is that namespace plus the
//! content slot. Because the handle names its namespace, one batch can
//! reference items from several pipelines.
//!
//! A `DlStore` is a pure follower: content allocates every slot and the store
//! only replays the deltas it is handed. Nothing here ever picks a slot, and
//! the inner level deliberately has no free list - if a store allocated for
//! itself the two sides would diverge with nothing able to notice.

// Nothing feeds a store yet: the scene builder thread starts driving the
// allocator and applying deltas in the next part of this series.
