//! A picture represents a dynamically rendered image.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Pictures consists of:
//!
//! - A number of primitives that are drawn onto the picture.
//! - A composite operation describing how to composite this
//!   picture into its parent.
//! - A configuration describing how to draw the primitives on
//!   this picture (e.g. in screen space or local space).
//!
//! The tree of pictures are generated during scene building.
//!
//! Depending on their composite operations pictures can be rendered into
//! intermediate targets or folded into their parent picture.
//!
//! ## Picture caching
//!
//! Pictures can be cached to reduce the amount of rasterization happening per
//! frame.
//!
//! When picture caching is enabled, the scene is cut into a small number of slices,
//! typically:
//!
//! - content slice
//! - UI slice
//! - background UI slice which is hidden by the other two slices most of the time.
//!
//! Each of these slice is made up of fixed-size large tiles of 2048x512 pixels
//! (or 128x128 for the UI slice).
//!
//! Tiles can be either cached rasterized content into a texture or "clear tiles"
//! that contain only a solid color rectangle rendered directly during the composite
//! pass.
//!
//! ## Invalidation
//!
//! Each tile keeps track of the elements that affect it, which can be:
//!
//! - primitives
//! - clips
//! - image keys
//! - opacity bindings
//! - transforms
//!
//! These dependency lists are built each frame and compared to the previous frame to
//! see if the tile changed.
//!
//! The tile's primitive dependency information is organized in a quadtree, each node
//! storing an index buffer of tile primitive dependencies.
//!
//! The union of the invalidated leaves of each quadtree produces a per-tile dirty rect
//! which defines the scissor rect used when replaying the tile's drawing commands and
//! can be used for partial present.
//!
//! ## Display List shape
//!
//! WR will first look for an iframe item in the root stacking context to apply
//! picture caching to. If that's not found, it will apply to the entire root
//! stacking context of the display list. Apart from that, the format of the
//! display list is not important to picture caching. Each time a new scroll root
//! is encountered, a new picture cache slice will be created. If the display
//! list contains more than some arbitrary number of slices (currently 8), the
//! content will all be squashed into a single slice, in order to save GPU memory
//! and compositing performance.
//!
//! ## Compositor Surfaces
//!
//! Sometimes, a primitive would prefer to exist as a native compositor surface.
//! This allows a large and/or regularly changing primitive (such as a video, or
//! webgl canvas) to be updated each frame without invalidating the content of
//! tiles, and can provide a significant performance win and battery saving.
//!
//! Since drawing a primitive as a compositor surface alters the ordering of
//! primitives in a tile, we use 'overlay tiles' to ensure correctness. If a
//! tile has a compositor surface, _and_ that tile has primitives that overlap
//! the compositor surface rect, the tile switches to be drawn in alpha mode.
//!
//! We rely on only promoting compositor surfaces that are opaque primitives.
//! With this assumption, the tile(s) that intersect the compositor surface get
//! a 'cutout' in the rectangle where the compositor surface exists (not the
//! entire tile), allowing that tile to be drawn as an alpha tile after the
//! compositor surface.
//!
//! Tiles are only drawn in overlay mode if there is content that exists on top
//! of the compositor surface. Otherwise, we can draw the tiles in the normal fast
//! path before the compositor surface is drawn. Use of the per-tile valid and
//! dirty rects ensure that we do a minimal amount of per-pixel work here to
//! blend the overlay tile (this is not always optimal right now, but will be
//! improved as a follow up).
